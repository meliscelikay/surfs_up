# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather and precipitation patters for Oahu, Hawaii so W. Avy  can determine whether opening a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable and prosperous business. Data set used expands over 7 years but I concentrated on mainly June and December months.

## Resources
- Data Source: [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/meliscelikay/surfs_up/blob/a205791ead695d8755e876bea774791fe78fcae7/hawaii.sqlite)
- Data Tools: `pandas`, `numpy`,`Python SQL toolkit (SQLAlchemy)`, `Object Relational Mapper`
- Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, SQLlite

## Results

- The average temperature of the month of June is at 75 degrees, minimum of 64 degrees, and maximum of 85 degrees based on count of 1,700 temperatures
- The average temperature of the month of June is at 71 degrees, minimum of 56 degrees, and maximum of 83 degrees based on count of 1,517 temperatures
- The temperature does not have dramatic fluctuations throughout the year.

## Summary

There is a reason why Hawaii remains one of the most popular vacation spots, specifically attracting surfers around the world. The temperature is relatively stable year around and wet season (rainy days) is short lived and not frequent. 

Precipitation: 
- June 14%

- December 22%

The stable range of temperatures throughout the year (4F deg difference) and relatively low precipitation levels in Oahu would be ideal for this type of business. We can also observe that temperature range is tightly concentrated around the average which shows consistency and stability especially in the month of June. 
It would have been interesting to analyze other variables such as wave height per month, water temperatures per month, tourist volume per month, and average money spent per tourist but since this business would be more catered towards “fun in the sun” visitors who just wants to enjoy a cone of cookie dough ice cream after a few paddles on a long board we can save that for another time. 

In conclusion, if W. Avy wants to open a surf and ice cream shop Oahu, Hawaii would be an ideal location for a profitable business.
